# Sample Size Selection using Confidence Intervals

In this section we will examine techniques to calculate the minimum
sample size required to obtain a confidence interval to be within a
specified margin of error. Recall the one-sample confidence intervals we
have constructed for a population mean $\mu$ are

$$\begin{aligned}
{3}
    & \bar{x} \, \pm \, z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}    && \quad \text{(When } \sigma \text{ is known)} \\[1.0em]
    & \bar{x} \, \pm \, t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}        && \quad    \text{(When } \sigma \text{ is not known)}
\end{aligned}$$

and the one-sample confidence interval for a proportion is

$$\hat p \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}$$

### Empirical Rule

For any sample from a population that is close to Normally distributed:

- about 68% of all observations will lie in the interval
  $\mu \pm \sigma$

- about 95% of all observations will lie in the interval
  $\mu \pm 2\sigma$

- about 99.7% of all observations will lie in the interval
  $\mu \pm 3\sigma$

This suggests that for a sample drawn from a population that is
approximately to Normally distributed, we can approximate the standard
deviation using

$$\hat{\sigma} \approx \frac{\text{Sample Range}}{4}.$$

## Calculating Sample Size for a Confidence Interval on a Mean {#secSampleSizeCIMean}

We will examine how to calculate the minimum sample size $n$ for a
confidence interval on a mean for a margin of error $E$ at confidence
level $1-\alpha$.

### When $\sigma$ is Known {#when-sigma-is-known .unnumbered}

For a desired margin of error $E$ and confidence level $1-\alpha$:
$$E = z_{\alpha/2}\,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

We can rearrange $E$ to calculate the sample size using
$$n = \left( \frac{z_{\alpha/2}\,\sigma}{E} \right)^2$$ where $n$ is
always *rounded up* to the next integer.\

::: example
[]{#exSampleSizePharmaceutical label="exSampleSizePharmaceutical"}

A manufacturer of pharmaceutical products analyzes a specimen from each
batch of a product to verify the concentration of the active ingredient.
The chemical analysis is not perfectly precise. Repeated measurements on
the same specimen give slightly different results. Suppose we know that
the results of repeated measurements follow a Normal distribution with
mean $\mu$ equal to the true concentration and standard deviation
$\sigma = 0.0068$ grams per liter. (That the mean of the population of
all measurements is the true concentration says that the measurements
process has no bias. The standard deviation describes the precision of
the measurement.) The laboratory analyzes each specimen $n$ times and
reports the mean result.\
Management asks the laboratory to produce results accurate to within
$\pm 0.005$ with 95% confidence. How many measurements must be averaged
to comply with this request?

$$n = \left( \displaystyle \frac{z_{0.025}\,\sigma}{E} \right)^2
    = \Bigl(\frac{1.96 \times 0.0068}{0.005}\Bigr)^2
    \approx 7.1$$ Since the sample size should be a whole number, we
round our result up to $n=8$ measurements.
:::

In Example
[\[exSampleSizePharmaceutical\]](#exSampleSizePharmaceutical){reference-type="ref"
reference="exSampleSizePharmaceutical"}, we note that 7 measurements
will give a slightly larger margin of error than desired, and 8
measurements a slightly smaller margin of error, the lab must take 8
measurements on each specimen to meet management's demand. Always round
up to the next higher whole number when finding $n$.

::: example
Planning value $\sigma=22.50$, desired margin $E=2$.

1.  90% confidence, $z_{0.05}=1.65$:
    $$n = \Bigl(\frac{1.65 \times 22.50}{2}\Bigr)^2
          \approx 344.6
        \quad\Longrightarrow\quad n = 345.$$

2.  95% confidence, $z_{0.025}=1.96$:
    $$n = \Bigl(\frac{1.96 \times 22.50}{2}\Bigr)^2
          \approx 486.2
        \quad\Longrightarrow\quad n = 487.$$

3.  99% confidence, $z_{0.005}=2.58$:
    $$n = \Bigl(\frac{2.58 \times 22.50}{2}\Bigr)^2
          \approx 842.5
        \quad\Longrightarrow\quad n = 843.$$

## Calculating Sample Size for a Confidence Interval on a Proportion

We will examine how to calculate the minimum sample size $n$ for a
confidence interval on a proportion for a margin of error $E$ at
confidence level $1-\alpha$. For sample of size $n$ with unknown
population proportion $p$:
$$\hat p \pm z^* \sqrt{ \displaystyle \frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}.$$
where the margin of error is
$$E=z^*\sqrt{ \displaystyle \frac{p^*(1-p^*)}{n}}$$ we can rearrange $E$
to calculate the sample size using
$$n = \left( \displaystyle \frac{z^*}{E} \right)^2\,p^*(1-p^*),$$ where
$p^*$ can be a *planning value*, which is value obtained from prior
information such as a pilot study. If we do not have any prior
information on $p^*$, we can use $p^* = 0.5$ which is the conservative
value that maximizes the product $p^*(1-p^*)$.

::: example
Aisha Shariff and Yvette Ye are the candidates for mayor in a large
city. You are planning a sample survey to determine what percent of the
voters plan to vote for Shariff. This is a population proportion $p$.
You will contact an SRS of registered voters in the city. You want to
estimate $p$ with 95% confidence and a margin of error no greater than
3%, or 0.03. How large a sample do you need?\
For a 95% CI on $p$: $z_{0.025} = 1.96$. Margin of error = 0.03. Since
no information on a good estimate of $p$, use $p^{*} = 0.5$.

$$1.96 \sqrt{\frac{(0.5)(1 - 0.5)}{n}} \le 0.03
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
n = \left(\frac{1.96}{0.03}\right)^{2} (0.5)(0.5) \approx 1067.1.$$
Round up: $$n = 1068.$$
:::

::: example
The percentage of people not covered by health care insurance in 2007 in
the USA was 15.6%. A congressional committee has been charged with
conducting a sample survey to obtain more current information.

1.  What sample size would you recommend if the committee's goal is to
    estimate the current proportion of individuals without health care
    insurance with a margin of error of 0.03? Use a 95% confidence
    level.

2.  Repeat part (a) using a 99% confidence level.

$$\text{(a) } n 
= 
\left(\frac{z^{*}}{E}\right)^{2}
p^{*}(1-p^{*}), 
\quad z^{*} = 1.96, \; E = 0.03,\; p^{*} = 0.156.$$ $$n
=
\left(\frac{1.96}{0.03}\right)^{2}
(0.156)(1 - 0.156)
\approx 563.$$

$$\text{(b) } n 
= 
\left(\frac{2.58}{0.03}\right)^{2}
(0.156)(1 - 0.156)
\approx 974.$$

::: example
A consumer advocacy group would like to find the proportion of consumers
who bought the newest generation of iPhone and were happy with their
purchase. How large a sample should they take to estimate $p$ with 2%
margin of error and 90% confidence?

**Parameters:** $$\begin{aligned}
E &= 0.02, \quad\text{(margin of error)}\\
\text{Confidence level} &= 0.90 \;\Longrightarrow\; \alpha = 0.10,\;\alpha/2 = 0.05,\\
z^{*} &= z_{0.05} = 1.645,\\
p^{*} &= 0.5,\quad p^{*}(1 - p^{*}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25.
\end{aligned}$$

**Sample‚ÄêSize Formula:**
$$n \;=\; \left(\frac{z^{*}}{E}\right)^{2}\;p^{*}(1 - p^{*}).$$

Substituting $z^{*} = 1.645$, $E = 0.02$, and $p^{*}(1 - p^{*}) = 0.25$:
$$\begin{aligned}
n 
&= \left(\frac{1.645}{0.02}\right)^{2} \times 0.25 
= \bigl(82.25\bigr)^{2} \times 0.25 
= 6{,}764.0625 \times 0.25 \\[0.5em]
&= 1{,}691.015625.
\end{aligned}$$

Since $n$ must be a whole number and we always round up to ensure the
margin of error is at most $2\%$, we take $$n = 1{,}692.$$
