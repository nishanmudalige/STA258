\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is Statistics} \label{ssec.defm}\markright{\ref{ssec.defm} \titleref{ssec.defm}}
\begin{itemize}
\item describe characteristics of a group of objects;
\item make inferences about the group.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Operationally}, this involves:
\begin{itemize}
\item collection of data through various means;
\item analysis and interpretation of the data.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Goal of Statistics}
As part of the interpretation, we include levels of accuracy in terms of probability statement.\\%\pause
Is to produce estimators of the population parameters based on usually a smaller sample, and to
quantify the accuracy of these estimators through probabilities.
\subsection{Statistics and Business Decision making}
Typically, for business, statistics is used for the purpose of informed decision
making that will lead to the most ``profitable" outcome.  Some examples incude:%\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] data mining%\pause
\item[2.] e-commerce%\pause
\item[3.] forecasting%\pause
\item[4.] investment analysis%\pause
\item[5.] marketing%\pause
\item[6.] pricing strategies%\pause
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Objectives of this course}

The objectives of this course is to provide:%\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] logical and critical thinking; %\pause
\item[2.] good statistical skills. %\pause
\end{itemize}
For use in a business decision setting.

{\bf TD: Real estate correction in store for Vancouver }

\bigskip	

Bank forecasts a sales drop of 15\% and a home-price decrease of 12\% in 2012 %\pause

\bigskip

{\small VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) - According to economists at the TD bank, "a larger-than-average price and sales correction looks to be in store" for the housing market in Vancouver. It forecasts a sales drop of 15\% and a home-price decrease of 12\% over the 2012-2013 period."

The outlook says ``since the summer some of the steam in prices and sales has escaped" the Vancouver market, leaving this area ``in a better position than...six months ago."

The TD points out that in November the seasonally adjusted average home price was \$756,000, the lowest to date in 2011. It also says sales growth has "come down from double-digit highs to a fairly flat, even slightly negative, year-over-year reading."

\section{Types of Data and Studies}

\subsection{Types of Data}


\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] \textbf{qualitative data} are categorial data usually used to denote various categories
for example the months in a year

\item[2.] \textbf{quantitative data} are numerical data that are often measured in units such as in
\$\$\$

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Studies}


\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] \textbf{observational studies} where data is used from published sources

\item[2.] \textbf{designed experiments} where data is created in some experiment

\item[3.] \textbf{case controlled studies} which is similar to a designed experiment except
that the data comes from past observations

\item[4.] \textbf{sample surveys}  which are similar to a designed experiment except that
the part of the population is surveyed (if you own a phone we're all familiar with this)

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Commonality}


No matter how one obtains data,

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] data is expensive to acquire;

\item[2.] computation is cheap once the infrastructure is in place.

\item[3.] your value (to your employer) will be how you put together the statistical
evidence that will ultimately translate into profitability to your employer

\end{itemize}

\section{Sample as Compared to Population}

\subsection{Quality of Sample}

Population is large but a sample is much smaller.

\smallskip

Since we want
to make inference on the population based on the characteristics
of the sample, one would need a ``representative sample".%\pause

\smallskip

In some cases one can control for this in designed experiments, or
sample surveys.%\pause

\smallskip

In other cases one has no control over the sample which is usually the
case in observational studies.%\pause

\smallskip

In all cases we would ideally draw a \textbf{random sample}, where
$n$ units are selected from a population in such a way the every sample of size
$n$ has an equal chance of selection.

\subsection{Possible Bias in Sample}%\pause

The standard form of biases occur as follows:
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] \textbf{selection bias} - sample not representative of population because a
subset of the population has no chance of being selected for the sample %\pause
\item[2.] \textbf{nonresponse bias} - respondentsÕ refusals to participate may be related to the response variable %\pause
\item[3.] \textbf{measurement error bias} - the response measured and recorded for an individual unit is not correct %\pause
\end{itemize}

\section{Plots from our Past}

\subsection{Bar Graphs and Pie Charts}

\textbf{Bar graphs} and \textbf{Pie Charts} are things we should be familiar with.  They are used for
qualitative data and provides frequencies in each category.

\bigskip

For example, consider the following data concerning inspection at an automobile assembly line.  It was
determined
that 70 of  the new cars produced on any given day had the following defects:


{\tiny
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
Defect&Frequency&Relative Frequency&Relative Frequency (\%)\\ \hline
Chrome&2&2/70&2.9\\
Dents&25&25/70&35.7\\
Paint&30&30/70&42.9\\
Upholstery&10&10/70&14.3\\
Windshield&3&3/70&4.3\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\vspace{-2cm}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{barpie}

\subsection{Histograms and Stemplots}

For quantitative data, there are a number of different plots, the one most
familiar is a \textbf{histogram}.

\bigskip

This requires one define a \textbf{class} - divide the data into intervals, followed by
plotting the frequency chart for each class.

\bigskip

For example, consider the delivery time (in days, from order to delivery) for an online
firm.

\bigskip

32 33 39 43 44 49 49 50 50 51 51 54 56 59 63 64 64 65 68 71 73 82 86 95 102


Data:  32 33 39 43 44 49 49 50 50 51 51 54 56 59 63 64 64 65 68 71 73 82 86 95 102

\bigskip

{\tiny
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
Class&Frequency&Relative Frequency&Percentage&Cumulative Frequency\\ \hline
26--45&5&5/25&20\%&5\\
46--65&13&13/25&52\%&18\\
66--85&4&4/25&16\%&22\\
86--105&3&3/25&12\%&25\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\vspace{-1cm}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{hist-1}

The choice of classes in the table above is somewhat arbitrary. We want to choose enough classes to give us a reasonable picture, but not so many that there are too few observations in each class. The more observations we have, the more classes we can include.
\vspace{-1cm}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{hist-2}

\textbf{Stemplots} are also known as stem-and-leaf plots because each observation (numerical value) is split into a stem and a leaf.

List the stems in a column and write out the leaves next to their corresponding stem.

{\tiny Data:  32 33 39 43 44 49 49 50 50 51 51 54 56 59 63 64 64 65 68 71 73 82 86 95 102}

{\tiny
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl|l}
Stem&Leaf&Represents the data \ \\ \hline
3 &239&32 33 39\\
4 &3499&43 44 49\\
5 &0011469&50 50 51 51 54 56 59 \\
6 &34458&63 64 64 65 68 \\
7 &13&71 73\\
8 &26&82 86\\
9 &5&95\\
10 &2&102\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}

This is only useful when data sets are small and is not very practical in todays data environment.

The \textbf{distribution} of data tells us what values it takes on, and how often it takes on these values (i.e. the frequencies).

\vspace{-1cm}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{hist-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]Where is the centre of the distribution?
\item[2.]How variable are the observations?
\item[3.]What is the shape of the distribution?
Is it symmetric?
\item[4.]Are there any outliers
that fall far from the overall pattern?
\end{itemize}
