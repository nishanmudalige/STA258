\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose a random sample of 100 observations from a binomial population gives a value of $\hat{p}=0.63$ and you with to test the null hypothesis that the population parameter $p$ is equal to 0.7 against the alternative hypothesis that $p$ is less than 0.7.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Noting that $\hat{p}=0.63$,what does your intuition tell you?Does the value of $\hat{p}$ appear to contradict the null hypothesis?
\item Use the large-sample $z$-test to test $H_0:p=0.7$ against $H_a:p<0.7$.Use $\alpha=0.05$.How do the test results compare with your intuitive decision from part a?
\item Find and interpret the observed significance level of the test you conducted in part b.
\end{enumerate}
\item Suppose the sample in question 1 has produced $\hat{p}=0.83$you are interested in conducting the statistical test of $H_0:p=0.9$ against $H_a:p<0.9$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Calculate the value of the $z$-statistics for this test.
\item  Complete the test using $\alpha=0.05$ and interpret the result.
\item  Find the observed significance level for the test and interpret its value.
\end{enumerate}
\item For binomial sample sizes and null hypothesized values of $p$ in each part,determine whether the sample size is large enough to use the normal approximation methodology presented in this section to conduct a test of the null hypothesis  $H_0:p=p_0$
  \begin{enumerate}
\item $n=900$,$p_0=0.975$
\item $n=125$,$p_0=0.01$
\item $n=40$,$p_0=0.75$
\item $n=15$,$p_0=0.75$
\item $n=12$,$p_0=0.62$
\end{enumerate}
