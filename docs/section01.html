<h1>Descriptive Statistics and an Introduction to R</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Intuitively, statistics can be considered the science of uncertainty.
Formally,</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Statistics is the science of collecting, classifying, summarizing,
analyzing and interpreting data.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Population, Sample, Parameter</strong></p>
<p>In statistics, researchers need to observe behavior, pattern, trends
and other types of data to give a conclusion. To make the conclusion
more persuasive, researchers require huge amount of data to support
them, that’s why study statistics need population.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>In statistics, a population is a set of similar observations which is
of interest for some experimental questions. It can be a set of existing
objects such as all people in Canada, or hypothetical group of existing
objects such as the set of all possible hands in a game of poker.</p>
</div>
<p>However, data collection from population is a lot work. Usually,
researchers select a finite number of observations to study.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>It refers to a selection of a subset from population that researchers
use it to estimate population characteristics.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, we have already chosen a sample, but how do we use it to
estimate population characteristics? This is the point where parameter
comes to play.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A parameter is a quantity of statistical population which summerizes
characteristics of the population. For example, mean, variance and
standard deviation.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</strong></p>
<p>Now, we have set everything we need. A population, a chosen sample in
that population with its parameters. Next step is studying. There are
two major types of analysis: descriptive and Inferential statistics. In
this section, we are only going to give you a rough idea about what they
are, more detailed materials will be introduced in later chapters.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>It refers to the summation of all quantitive values that describe
characteristics of the population. Usually, we use descriptive
statistics to summerize characteristics of a data set.</p>
</div>
<p>Furthermore, we use inferential statistics to do statistical
analysis.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>It refers to the process of using data analysis to indicate
properties of a population. For example, testing hypothesis and
confidence interval (both will be introduced in later chapters).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Qualitative and Quantitative Data</strong></p>
<p>At this point, assume that we have finished all procedures such as
obtaining parameters and analyzing properties. Now, another important
thing is illustrating all the discovery.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>This type of illustration refers to showing categorical data. For
example, lecture notes from a course, open-question survey.</p>
</div>
<p>To illustrate numerical data, we use quantitative data.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Unless the previous type of illustration, quantitative data is
represented numerically, including anything that can be counted,
measured, or given a numerical value. For example, STA258 final mark
score range from 100 different students who have taken this course.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="descriptive-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
<p>Previously, we defined descriptive statistics. Now, let’s introduce
what exact they are.<br />
<strong>Sample Mean, Variance and Standard Deviation</strong></p>
<p>Sample mean (or sample average) is the average value of a sample
which is selected from an interested population of an experiment.
Usually, the sample mean is used to estimate population mean. In other
words, we say that the sample mean is an estimator of population
mean.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n\)</span> be a
sample of data points. We define sample mean of the sample data points
(<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>) as the following: <span
class="math display">\[\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}
x_i.\]</span> Also, we define sample variance of the sample data points
(<span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>) as: <span
class="math display">\[s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i -
\bar{x})^2.\]</span> Moreover, the standard deviation of the sample of
data points (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) is: <span
class="math display">\[s = \sqrt{s^2}, \quad \text{for } s &gt;
0.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s move to variance. It refers to the expected value of the
squared deviation from the mean of a random variable in a population.
Similarly, we do have sample variance as well, which is the expected
value of the squared deviation from the mean of a random variable in a
selected sample. At this point, we can still use sample variance to
estimate population variance with adjustment, because the sample
variance may differ significantly based on what data points are chosen
from that population.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n\)</span> be a
sample of data points, we define sample variance of the sample data
points (<span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>) as: <span
class="math display">\[s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i -
\bar{x})^2, \text{ where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of the data
points.}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Next is standard deviation. It is a measure of the amount of
variation of the values of a variable about its mean. If standard
deviation is relatively larger, then data points are widely spread out
from the mean. Otherwise, data points stay close from the mean. Also,
standard deviation is obtained by taking squared root from variance
which is dependent on the choices of data points as well. To use sample
standard deviation as an estimator to population standard deviation, we
still need to adjust it.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n\)</span> be a
sample of data points. The standard deviation of the sample of data
points (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) is: <span
class="math display">\[s = \sqrt{s^2}, \quad \text{for } s &gt;
0.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Median and Mode</strong></p>
<p>The median and mode are two important measures of central tendency
used in statistics to summarize and understand data. The median
represents the middle value in a sorted dataset, giving a sense of the
center that is not affected by extreme values or outliers. In contrast,
the mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset, making
it useful for identifying common or repeated observations.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let: <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n\)</span> be
a collection of data points which is arranged in ascending order from
the smallest value to the largest value (or descending order from the
largest value to the smallest value in that collection). The median of
the given collection of data points is the middle value in that
collection, which equally spreads the collection into two parts. Half of
all the collection values are above the median value and the rest of the
values in the collection is below the median value.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Case 1: when n is an odd number. (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(1, 3, 11, 237,...\)</span>). Then, the median
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is defined as: <span
class="math display">\[M = \frac{n+1}{2} \text{, where n represents the
$n^{th}$ position}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Case 2: when n is an even number (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(2, 6, 100, 500,...\)</span>). Then, the median
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is: the average value of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{2}\)</span>’s and <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{n+2}{2}\)</span>’s position, where n
represents the <span class="math inline">\(n^{th}\)</span>
position.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s introduce mode.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>It refers to a value that appears the most frequent than the
appearance of all other values in a given dataset.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Percentile and Quartile</strong></p>
<p>Percentiles and quartiles are statistical measures used to describe
the distribution of data. A percentile indicates the value below which a
given percentage of observations fall, helping to understand relative
standing within a dataset. Quartiles, a specific type of percentile,
divide the data into four equal parts (Q1, Q2/median, and Q3), providing
insights into the spread and central tendency.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let: <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)</span> be a
collection of data points in either ascending order. Percentile is
denoted as: <span class="math inline">\(p^{th}\)</span>, which indicates
<span class="math inline">\(p \%\)</span> of observations are below to a
such value. Quartiles, are special cases of percentile which equally
spread the collection of data into four parts. Each part contains <span
class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> of the entire collection. More
specifically, we define quartiles as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>: the <span
class="math inline">\(25\)</span> percentile (or <span
class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span>), which shows that <span
class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> of the data points are below the
value <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Q_2\)</span>: the <span
class="math inline">\(50\)</span> percentile (or <span
class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span>), which shows that <span
class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> of the data points are below the
value <span class="math inline">\(Q_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>: the <span
class="math inline">\(75\)</span> percentile (or <span
class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span>), which shows that <span
class="math inline">\(75\%\)</span> of the data points are below the
value <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Q_2\)</span> is qual to
median.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, we use <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 - Q_1\)</span> to
calculate interquartile range (I.P.R), which shows the spread of the
whole data set.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Skewness and Symmetry</strong></p>
<p>The two terms ‘skewness’ and ‘symmetry’ are used to describe the
shape of probability distribution. There are two types of skewness: left
(or negative) skew and right (or positive) skew. In real life, a famous
distribution highly used in hypothesis testing which is <span
class="math inline">\(\chi_{n}^{2}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> degrees of freedom, is right skewed
probability distribution function. Another example regarding to symmetry
is normal distribution such that its probability under its curve greater
than <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is same as the probability
below than <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Now let’s introduce
the proper definition of skewness and symmetry.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Skewness refers to such a measure of the asymmetry of the probability
distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The
skewness value can be positive, zero, negative or undefined.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s break down the main definition of skewness and
symmetry:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>By observing given probability distribution curve, if the left tail
of the curve is longer than the right tail the mass of the distribution
is concentrated on the right of the figure, then we say that probability
distribution is left skew or negative skew. (See figure below)</p>
</div>
<div class="float">

alt="Visualization of left skew probability distribution" />
<div class="figcaption">Visualization of left skew probability
distribution</div>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p>By observing given probability distribution curve, if the right tail
of the curve is longer than the left tail the mass of the distribution
is concentrated on the left of the figure, then we say that probability
distribution is right skew or positive skew. (See figure below)</p>
</div>
<div class="float">
<img src="Section1/img/Rightskew.jpg"
alt="Visualization of right skew probability distribution" />
<div class="figcaption">Visualization of right skew probability
distribution</div>
</div>
<p>Symmetry is a special case of skewness when the value of skewness is
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>In statistics, symmetry s a probability distribution is reflected
around a vertical line at some value of the random variable represented
by the distribution. Probability under the curve below that value is
equal to probability under the curve greater than that value. (see
figure below)</p>
</div>
<p>Since symmetry is a special case, so that it has a unique property as
the following:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>For any symmetric (bell-shaped) curve, let <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> be its mean and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> be its standard deviation, the
following probability set function is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1.\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(P(\mu - \sigma &lt; X &lt; \mu + \sigma) =
68.27\%;\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(2.\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(P(\mu - 2\sigma &lt; X &lt; \mu + 2\sigma) =
95.45\%;\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(3.\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(P(\mu - 3\sigma &lt; X &lt; \mu + 3\sigma) =
99.73\%.\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float">

</div>
<p><strong>Practice Example</strong></p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let: <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_3 = 7\)</span>. Calculate the sample mean,
sample variance and sample standard deviation for this collection of
data points.<br />
Solution (all results are kept in four digits):<br />
By Definition <span class="math inline">\(1.9 \text{, } 1.10 \text{, }
1.11\)</span>, sample mean: <span class="math display">\[\bar{x} =
\frac{1+3+7}{3} \approx 3.6667.\]</span> Then, we use sample mean to
calculate sample variance: <span class="math display">\[s^2 =
\frac{1}{3-1} \times [(1-3.6667)^2+(3-3.6667)^2+(7-3.6667)^2] \approx
9.3333.\]</span> Finally, we take the square root of sample variance to
get sample deviation, and remember that <span class="math inline">\(s
&gt; 0\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx
3.0551.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Given two distinct collections of data points: <span
class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\{2, 4,
6\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> = <span
class="math inline">\(\{1, 5, 16, 28\}\)</span>. Calculate the median of
both two sets.<br />
Solution:<br />
For <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\(n = 3\)</span> which is an odd number, so by <span
class="math inline">\(Definition \text{ } 1.3\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(M_{S_1} = 4\)</span>. For <span
class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n =
4\)</span> in this case, so that we need to calculate the average of
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{2}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{n+1}{2}\)</span>. Then, <span
class="math display">\[M_{S_2} = \frac{5+16}{2} = 10.5.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the data set <span class="math inline">\(S =\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\{4, 25, 30, 30, 30, 32, 32, 35, 50, 50, 50, 55,
60, 74, 110\}\)</span>. Calculate its median and <span
class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span>).<br />
Solution:<br />
Simply counting the number of data points, <span class="math inline">\(n
= 15\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(M_{S}\)</span> =
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{15 + 1}{2}\)</span> = <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>. Thus, the <span
class="math inline">\(8^{th}\)</span> value in the set which is <span
class="math inline">\(35\)</span>.<br />
Since we know the median of this collection of data points, we just need
to find the median of the lower half of this data, which is exactly
going to be <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span> percentile (<span
class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span>). In the lower half of the given
collection (all values below the median), <span
class="math inline">\(n_{lower} = 7\)</span>. By <span
class="math inline">\(Definition \text{ } 1.3\)</span>, then median of
the lower half (<span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span>) is going
to be: <span class="math display">\[25^{th} = \frac{7+1}{2} = 4, \text{
the $4^{th}$ position in the data set}.\]</span> Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span>) <span class="math inline">\(=
30\)</span>. To find <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span>), apply the same strategy will
guide you to find the correct answer, and we leave this as an exercise
to you.</p>

for example histograms and box-plots. This technique is used in the
field of statistics for data visualization. Our objective is to both be
able to identify some classical types of graph and interpret key
statistical values (descriptive statistical values) from it.</p>

<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p><strong>Introduction to Histograms</strong></p>
<p>Histogram is a graphical representation of data that uses bars to
display the frequency distribution of a dataset. Unlike bar graphs,
which represent categorical data, histograms group numerical data into
intervals (bins) and show how many values fall into each range. This
makes histograms ideal for visualizing the shape, spread, and central
tendency of continuous data, helping identify patterns such as symmetry,
skewness, and outliers.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Histograms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages of Histograms:<br />
<span class="math inline">\(1.\)</span> Histograms are easily to used
for visualise data (relatively). It allows us to get the idea of the
"shape" of distribution (i.e. skewness which will be discussed late in
this section).<br />
<span class="math inline">\(2.\)</span> It is also flexible that people
are able to modify bin widths.</p></li>
<li><p>Disadvantages of Histograms:<br />
<span class="math inline">\(1.\)</span> It is not suitable for small
data sets.<br />
<span class="math inline">\(2.\)</span> The values from histograms close
to breaking points are likely similar, in fact they need to be
classified into different bins (i.e. Student A and B scores 79 and 80
respectively in STA258, we consider a breaking point between 79 and 80.
The two students have similar score, but student A is <span
class="math inline">\(B+\)</span> and student B is <span
class="math inline">\(A-\)</span> in GPA from).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Histograms with Skewness and Symmetry</strong></p>
<p>A histogram visually represents the distribution of numerical data,
making it a useful tool for assessing skewness and symmetry. It is quite
straightforward to estimate the skewness of histograms by simply drawing
a curve above bins on the histogram.<br />
For a histogram to have a left (or negative) skew probability
distribution:</p>

<p>For a histogram to have a right (or positive) skew probability
distribution:</p>

<div id="box-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Box-Plots</h3>
<p>A boxplot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a standardized way to display
data distribution based on a five-number summary: minimum, first
quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. The box
represents the interquartile range (IQR), while the whiskers show
variability outside Q1 and Q3. Outliers are plotted as individual
points. Boxplots efficiently compare distributions and highlight
skewness, spread, and outliers. (See figure below)</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="Section1/img/BoxPlot.jpg" alt="Visualization of a box-plot" />
<div class="figcaption">Visualization of a box-plot</div>
</div>
<p>Similar to histograms, we can still obtain information about skewness
and symmetry, by observing the cut from the line of Q2.<br />
If the median (Q2) cuts the box with upper area smaller than lower area,
then we say that box-plot with left skew probability distribution. Or,
if the median (Q2) cuts the box with upper area larger than lower area,
then we say that box-plot with right skew probability
distribution.<br />
Otherwise, if the median (Q2) cuts the box with upper area equal to
lower area, then we say that box-plot with symmetric probability
distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduction to R</h2>
<p>R is used for data manipulation, statistics, and graphics. It is made
of: operations (<span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>,<span
class="math inline">\(-\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>) which is for calculations on
vectors, arrays and matrices; a huge collection of functions; facilities
for making unlimited types quality graphs; user contributed packages
(sets of related functions); the ability to interface with procedures
written in C, C+, or FORTRAN and to write additional primitives. R is
also an open-source computing package which has seen a huge growth in
popularity in the last few years (Please use this website: <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org"
class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org</a>, to download R).<br />
<strong>What is R-studio?</strong></p>
<p>RStudio is a relatively new editor specially targeted at R. RStudio
is cross-platform, free and open-source software (Please use: <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com</a>,
to download Rstudio).<br />
<strong>Make a Histogram Using R-studio</strong></p>
<p>This is just a demonstration of how to start and use R-studio.</p>
<p>. First of all, we need to know which dataset are we going to make
into a histogram. In this case, as an example, we are going to use the
waiting time in faithful in R-studio.<br />
2. For any dataset, use the code: names(faithful) to get it. (inside the
parentheses, type the names of variables you want in faithful
dataset)<br />
3. Then, we proceed with the code: hist(faithful$waiting) to get a basic
plot.<br />

<div class="figcaption">R-studio first three steps (by following the

</div>
<p>. Furthermore, we can also get more information. For example, by keep
proceeding with the code: hist(faithful$waiting,plot=FALSE)$breaks,
R-studio will show you all the breaking points between histogram
cells.</p>
