To fulfill these objectives we will be utilizing two park visitation data sets from the National Park Service (NPS): NPS-wide visitation data, and park unit-specific visitation data. There are seven exercises in this lesson that must be completed. 1.1 APIs An API is software that acts as an intermediary between an online data warehouse (or server) and its users (or clients). As data scientists, APIs provide us a way to request clean and nicely-formatted data that the server will then send to our local computers, all within our RStudio console! To work with APIs, we will need to use two new packages: httr, which allows us to communicate with the API’s server, and jsonlite, which allows us to work with one of the most common API data formats, JSON. Let’s go ahead and load in our packages for this lesson: library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ── ## ✔ forcats 1.0.0 ✔ readr 2.1.5 ## ✔ ggplot2 3.5.2 ✔ stringr 1.5.1 ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4 ✔ tibble 3.2.1 ## ✔ purrr 1.0.4 ✔ tidyr 1.3.1 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors library(httr) library(jsonlite) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;jsonlite&#39; ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:purrr&#39;: ## ## flatten 1.1.1 NPS Visitation Data This week, we will be exploring NPS visitor use data across the NPS system as a whole, and and across specific park units. Like many institutions, NPS has a server that stores all of this information (as well as many other things), and an API for users to be able to access it. To utilize the NPS API in R, we first need to explore its API’s data structure. In almost every case, we use URLs to access specific data from APIs. To find the access URL for NPS visitation data, go to Stats Rest API - Documentation (though not very intuitive, the NPS API calls its visitation data set “Stats”). Listed there you will see that all data associated with the “Stats” data set can be accessed using the base URL https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats. From there, you can tack on additional html text to access two different data sets: total/{year} and visitation. For starters, let’s try accessing the total/{year}. This data set gives us total monthly visitation across all NPS park units, for a user-selected year: https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats/total/{YEAR} If you tried accessing that URL, you’ll have noticed it doesn’t take you anywhere. This is because the curly brackets {} signify locations in the URL that need to be updated by the user based on their specific needs. I’m curious about visitor use in my birth year, so let’s tweak the URL to access visitation data from 1992. In R, we can access this data using httr’s GET() function, replacing {YEAR} with 1992. raw_data &lt;- httr::GET(url = &quot;https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats/total/1992&quot;) # view raw_data # View(raw_data) Viewing the data set as-is, you can see it is not super human-readable. This is because data sent from APIs is typically packaged using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). To unpack the data, we will first need to use httr’s content() function. In this example, we want the data to be extracted as text, since this is a data table. Moreover, its encoding is listed as UTF-8. The encoding parameter can be found by opening our raw data set in our R console: raw_data # lists &#39;UTF-8&#39; ## Response [https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats/total/1992] ## Date: 2025-06-25 17:32 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 ## Size: 1.42 kB # convert content to text unpacked_data &lt;- httr::content(raw_data, as = &quot;text&quot;, encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;) Second, we need to transform this string of text, which is still in JSON formatting, into a data frame using jsonlite’s fromJSON(): # parse text from JSON to data frame final_data &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(unpacked_data) final_data ## Month NonRecreationVisitors RecreationVisitors UnitCode UnitName Year ## 1 1 6209285 10940618 NA NA 1992 ## 2 2 6010027 11931340 NA NA 1992 ## 3 3 6756902 15369139 NA NA 1992 ## 4 4 7255782 21458739 NA NA 1992 ## 5 5 7690763 26648530 NA NA 1992 ## 6 6 7593227 33284625 NA NA 1992 ## 7 7 8438755 41099305 NA NA 1992 ## 8 8 8056823 38625804 NA NA 1992 ## 9 9 7329755 26438266 NA NA 1992 ## 10 10 7105574 23616057 NA NA 1992 ## 11 11 6507805 14338165 NA NA 1992 ## 12 12 6702698 10943961 NA NA 1992 Hooray, you have now successfully pulled in an online data set using an API! 😁 1.1.1.1 Exercise #1 Using the code above as a starting point, pull in monthly NPS-wide visitation data for the years 1980, 1999, and 2018. 1.1.1.2 Exercise #2 Now, let’s explore the second NPS visitation data set, visitation. This call pulls in monthly data for a specific park, across a specific time frame. Use your new API skills to pull in visitation data for Rocky Mountain National Park from 2010 through 2021, based on the API’s URL template. The unit code for Rocky Mountain National Park is ROMO. (Hint: an API URL can have multiple sections that need to be updated by the user.) 1.2 Functions You may find yourself thinking, “Wow, exercise 1 was overkill!” Indeed, you had to run several lines of code that were nearly identical to what was shown upstream; the only thing you needed to change from one year to the next was the year itself. This sort of redundant coding is not good coding practice. Instead of copying and pasting many coding steps over and over again and tweaking just a tiny portion of it, we can write functions that combine many coding steps into just one command. The benefits of reducing redundant code in this way are threefold. As Grolemund &amp; Wickham describe in their book, R for Data Science: It’s easier to see the intent of your code, because your eyes are drawn to what’s different, not what stays the same. It’s easier to respond to changes in requirements. As your needs change, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than remembering to change every place that you copied-and-pasted the code. You’re likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places. Functions provide the option of changing just a minor part of the code base from one run to the next. Think of the GET() function in httr: it is a function that has code under-the-hood so that it isn’t necessary to write out the raw code each time we use it. Instead, we call out the function’s name (GET()), and the necessary argument within that function that tweaks the code to fit it to our needs (url = \"&lt;SOME_URL_WE_CHOOSE&gt;\"). 1.2.1 Functionize API Pulls Let’s try making a function called parkwide_visitation() that pulls in NPS-wide visitation data for a year of choice. To develop a function requires specific formatting: &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;- function(&lt;ARGUMENTS&gt;){ &lt;ACTIONS&gt; return(&lt;OUTPUT&gt;) } … where NAME is what we want to name the function; ARGUMENTS are the variables in the code that get “tweaked”; ACTIONS are the lines of code we want the function to perform (which includes our ARGUMENTS); and the OUTPUT is the object we want as the final outcome of running the function. For parkwide_visitation(), we will use our upstream code as the basis for our function, but with a few minor yet extremely important tweaks: parkwide_visitation &lt;- function(year){ # pull in the data raw_data &lt;- httr::GET(url = # parse out year so that it can be chosen with the &quot;year&quot; argument, using paste0() paste0(&quot;https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats/total/&quot;, year)) # convert content to text extracted_data &lt;- httr::content(raw_data, as = &quot;text&quot;, encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;) # parse text from JSON to data frame final_data &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(extracted_data) return(final_data) } In the above function, our first object, raw_data, now changes based on how we define our year argument. We accomplish this through paste0(), which takes listed objects, transforms them into characters (if they aren’t already), and concatenates them into a single character string. For example: my_sentence &lt;- &quot;I need at least&quot; my_other_sentence &lt;- &quot;pints of ice cream a day&quot; paste0(my_sentence, &quot; &quot;, 08, &quot; &quot;, my_other_sentence, &quot;!&quot;) ## [1] &quot;I need at least 8 pints of ice cream a day!&quot; So, if we make year = 2021 in our parkwide_visitation() function, the year object becomes the number 2021, which makes the paste0() output “https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats/total/2021”, which subsequently pulls data for 2021. In other words, we can now pull visitation data for any year with just one line of code! pull_2018 &lt;- parkwide_visitation(year = 2018) pull_1980 &lt;- parkwide_visitation(year = 1980) pull_1992 &lt;- parkwide_visitation(year = 1992) # ... and so on! 1.2.1.1 Exercise #3 Create a function called unit_visitation() that pulls park-specific visitation data for any park, across any time frame. For a list of all park codes, download this spreadsheet. (Hint 1: functions can have multiple arguments. Hint 2: what’s the difference between 05 and \"05\"?) 1.2.1.2 Exercise #4 Using unit_visitation(), pull in visitation data for Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO), Everglades National Park (EVER), and Theodore Roosevelt National Park (THRO) from 1990 through 2021. 1.2.2 Function Defaults Look at the code that you just wrote; writing out all of those unchanging date arguments still feels repetitive, right? When developing functions, there is an option for setting default values for arguments so that you don’t necessarily have to write all of them out every time you run it in the future. But, the option still exists within the function to make changes when necessary. For example, let’s tweak our parkwide_visitaion() function to have the default year be 2021: parkwide_visitation &lt;- function(year = &quot;2021&quot;) { raw_data &lt;- httr::GET(url = paste0(&quot;https://irmaservices.nps.gov/v3/rest/stats/total/&quot;, year)) # convert content to text extracted_data &lt;- httr::content(raw_data, as = &quot;text&quot;, encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;) # parse text from JSON to data frame final_data &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(extracted_data) return(final_data) } parkwide_visitation() ## Month NonRecreationVisitors RecreationVisitors UnitCode UnitName Year ## 1 1 11632614 11978413 NA NA 2021 ## 2 2 11082899 11692967 NA NA 2021 ## 3 3 12981524 18370611 NA NA 2021 ## 4 4 12857567 22155245 NA NA 2021 ## 5 5 13250575 27963739 NA NA 2021 ## 6 6 13789961 36122392 NA NA 2021 ## 7 7 14734920 41329530 NA NA 2021 ## 8 8 14280304 35380986 NA NA 2021 ## 9 9 13382939 30204635 NA NA 2021 ## 10 10 13882165 26961779 NA NA 2021 ## 11 11 13192146 18903397 NA NA 2021 ## 12 12 13007065 16051712 NA NA 2021 Because the default year is 2021, you don’t have to write it out explicitly in the function (so long as that’s the year you’re interested in). But, you still have the option of changing the year to something else: parkwide_visitation(year = &quot;1992&quot;) ## Month NonRecreationVisitors RecreationVisitors UnitCode UnitName Year ## 1 1 6209285 10940618 NA NA 1992 ## 2 2 6010027 11931340 NA NA 1992 ## 3 3 6756902 15369139 NA NA 1992 ## 4 4 7255782 21458739 NA NA 1992 ## 5 5 7690763 26648530 NA NA 1992 ## 6 6 7593227 33284625 NA NA 1992 ## 7 7 8438755 41099305 NA NA 1992 ## 8 8 8056823 38625804 NA NA 1992 ## 9 9 7329755 26438266 NA NA 1992 ## 10 10 7105574 23616057 NA NA 1992 ## 11 11 6507805 14338165 NA NA 1992 ## 12 12 6702698 10943961 NA NA 1992 1.2.2.1 Exercise #5 Default our unit_visitation() function’s arguments related to the starting and ending months to January and December, respectively. This way, we are automatically pulling in data for entire years. Rerun the function for ROMO, EVER, and THRO for the 1980-2021 time period to make sure it works properly. 1.3 Iterations At this point, we now know how to develop functions so that we do not have to keep writing out redundant steps in a workflow. However, in that last exercise, you can see that we are still writing out redundant code; we are performing the exact same function on each of our three park units. Another tool for reducing redundancy is iteration, which allows you to do the same thing on multiple inputs. Iteration can happen across different objects, different rows, different data frames, the list goes on and on! 1.3.1 for loops A for loop is base R’s iteration tool that executes code across a vector, an array, a list, etc. To save the outcome of each iteration, you must first create a vector to store the outputs in that is sized based on how many objects you want to iterate over. For example, I want to run our parkwide_visitation() function over the last five years: 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. To do that, I will first need to develop a vector listing each year: years &lt;- c(&#39;2017&#39;, &#39;2018&#39;, &#39;2019&#39;, &#39;2020&#39;, &#39;2021&#39;) … and then develop an empty list to store each year’s parkwide_visitation() results (i.e., output) into: output_floop &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length = length(years)) Now that we have a place to store each year’s function results, we can move forward with the for loop itself: for(i in 1:length(years)){ output_floop[[i]] &lt;- parkwide_visitation(year = years[i]) } … where years[i] tells the for loop to perform parkwide_visitation() on the ith year (think of i as a moving across each year), and output_floop[[i]] directs the for loop to store the results of the ith year’s run into output’s ith list (think of output_floop[[i]] as the location in output_floop that the ith’s results go). We now have a list containing five data frames: one for each year of visitation data: summary(output_floop) ## Length Class Mode ## [1,] 6 data.frame list ## [2,] 6 data.frame list ## [3,] 6 data.frame list ## [4,] 6 data.frame list ## [5,] 6 data.frame list Because each year’s output is structured identically, we can confidently combine each year’s data frame into a single data frame using dplyr::bind_rows(): multi_years &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(output_floop) 1.3.1.1 Exercise #6 Use a for loop to run unit_visitation() with arguments start_year = 1980 and end_year = 2021 across ROMO, EVER, and THRO. Then, create a single data frame containing each park units’ output. (Hint: Your first step will be to create a vector listing each park unit.) 1.3.2 Mapping The tidyverse’s purrr package has its own iteration function, map(), that is a variation of the for loop. map() takes a vector and applies a single function across it, then automatically stores all of the results into a list. In other words, map() creates an appropriately sized list to store our results in for us. This eliminates the need to create an empty list ahead of time. To create the same output as our previous for loop on parkwide_visitation(), but using map() instead, we would run the following code: output_map &lt;- years %&gt;% map(~ parkwide_visitation(year = .)) … where ~ indicates that we want to perform parkwide_visitation() across all years, and . indicates that we want to use our piped vector, years, as the input to the year argument. As you can see, output_map is identical to output_floop: identical(output_floop, output_map) ## [1] TRUE … which means we should also bind_rows() to get the mapped output into a single data frame: multi_years &lt;- bind_rows(output_map) 1.3.2.1 Exercise #7 Use map() to run unit_visitation() with arguments start_year = 1980 and end_year = 2021 across ROMO, EVER, and THRO. Then, create a single data frame containing each park units’ output. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
