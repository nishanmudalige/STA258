# Statistical Power


::: definition
The probability that a fixed level $\alpha$ significance test will
reject $H_0$ when a particular alternative value of the parameter is
true is called the **power** of the test against that alternative.
:::

The statistical power of a test is its ability to detect an effect if it
exists in reality.

It is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false
in reality.

$$\text{Power} = P(\text{reject } H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ false})$$

$$0 < \text{power} < 1$$

Power close to 1 (high power):\
Test is good at detecting effects.\
Power close to 0 (low power):\
Test is not reliable (i.e., we expect the test will not reject $H_0$
when $H_0$ is false).

Power is affected by:

- **The effect**\
  ([larger differences between reality and the null are easier to
  detect]{style="color: blue"})

- **Sample size**\
  ([larger samples increase power]{style="color: blue"})

- **Significance level** ($\alpha$)\
  ([as $\alpha$ increases, easier to reject $H_0$]{style="color: blue"})

- **Variability in data**\
  ([lower variability, higher power]{style="color: blue"})

### Type I and II Errors {#type-i-and-ii-errors .unnumbered}

It is possible to make an incorrect conclusion on a hypothesis test.\
**Type I:** Incorrectly reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true in reality.\
**Type II:** Incorrectly fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false in
reality.\

***Note:*** Type I errors are generally considered worse.

Let $\beta$ be the probability of a Type II error. Then:

$$\text{Power} = 1 - \beta = 1 - P(\text{Type II})$$

::::: example
The cola maker determines that a sweetness loss is too large to accept
if the mean response for all tasters is $\mu = 1.1$. Will a 5%
significance test detect this?

**Hypotheses:** $$\begin{aligned}
H_0\!:&\ \mu = 0 \\
H_A\!:&\ \mu > 0
\end{aligned}$$

Assume: $$n = 10, \quad \sigma = 1, \quad \alpha = 0.05$$

**Step 1: Determine the rejection region.**

Since the test is one-sided with $\alpha = 0.05$, we find:
$$z_{\text{crit}} = 1.645 \quad \text{(from Z-table)}$$

We reject $H_0$ if: $$Z^* > 1.645$$

y <- dnorm(x)

y_reject <- dnorm(x_reject)

# Plot

           label = expression("Reject " * H[0]), size = 4) +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```

:::

**Step 2: Find the equivalent critical value of** $\bar{x}$.

Since $\sigma$ is known,
$$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
1.645 = \frac{\bar{x}_{\text{crit}} - 0}{1/\sqrt{10}} \Rightarrow \bar{x}_{\text{crit}} \approx 0.520$$

So we reject $H_0$ if $\bar{x} > 0.520$.

**Step 3: Calculate the power when $\mu = 1.1$ is true.**

$$P\left(Z > \frac{0.520 - 1.1}{1/\sqrt{10}}\right)
\approx P(Z > -1.83) = 1 - 0.0336 = 0.9664$$

**Interpretation:** There is a 96.6% chance the test correctly detects
$\mu = 1.1$.

## Type I and Type II Errors

If we reject $H_0$ when in fact $H_0$ is true, this is a **Type I
error.**\
If we fail to reject $H_0$ when in fact $H_a$ is true, this is a **Type
II error.**\
The **significance level** $\alpha$ of any fixed level test is the
probability of a Type I error.\
The **power** of a test against any alternative is 1 minus the
probability of a Type II error for that alternative.\
The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by $\beta$.

::: tcolorbox
**Type I Error**\
$H_0$ is true, but sampling variation in the data leads you to reject
$H_0$, you've made a Type I error.\
When $H_0$ is true, a Type I error occurs if $H_0$ is rejected.\
**Type II Error**\
$H_0$ is false, but sampling variation in the data does not lead you to
reject $H_0$, you've made a Type II error.\
When $H_0$ is false, a Type II error occurs if $H_0$ is **NOT**
rejected.

::: example
Bottles of a popular cola are supposed to contain 300 milliliters (ml)
of cola. There is some variation from bottle to bottle because the
filling machinery is not perfectly precise. The distribution of contents
is Normal with standard deviation $\sigma = 3$ ml. Will inspecting 6
bottles discover underfilling?

The hypotheses are: $$\begin{aligned}
H_0\!:&\ \mu = 300 \\
H_a\!:&\ \mu < 300
\end{aligned}$$

A 5% significance test rejects $H_0$ if $z_* \leq -1.645$, where the
test statistic $z_*$ is: $$z_* = \frac{\bar{x} - 300}{3 / \sqrt{6}}$$

Power calculations help us see how large a shortfall in the bottle
contents the test can be expected to detect. Find the power of this test
against the alternative $\mu = 299$.

**Step 1. Write the rule for rejecting $H_0$ in terms of $\bar{x}$.**

We know that $\sigma = 3$, so the $z$ test rejects $H_0$ at the
$\alpha = 0.05$ level when:
$$z = \frac{\bar{x} - 300}{3 / \sqrt{6}} < -1.645$$

This is the same as:
$$\bar{x} < 300 - 1.645 \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{6}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \bar{x} < 297.985$$

**Step 2. The power is the probability of this event under the condition
that the alternative $\mu = 299$ is true.**

To calculate this probability, standardize $\bar{x}$ using $\mu = 299$:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{power} &= P(\bar{x} < 297.985 \mid \mu = 299) \\
&= P\left( Z < \frac{297.985 - 299}{3 / \sqrt{6}} \right) \\
&= P(Z < -0.83) = 0.2033
\end{aligned}$$

## Using Power to Determine Sample Size

When designing a study, one of the most important decisions is how large
a sample to collect. If the sample size is too small, even meaningful
effects may go undetected due to low statistical power. On the other
hand, collecting an unnecessarily large sample can be inefficient and
costly. By using power calculations, researchers can determine the
minimum sample size needed to detect an effect of a given size with a
specified probability (power), while controlling for Type I error. This
section introduces how statistical power is used in planning and
justifying sample sizes before conducting a hypothesis test.

::: example
Suppose an experimenter wishes to test $$\begin{aligned}
H_0\!:&\ \mu = 100 \\
H_a\!:&\ \mu > 100
\end{aligned}$$ at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance and wants
$1 - \beta$ to equal 0.60 when $\mu = 103$. What is the smallest (i.e.,
cheapest) sample size that will achieve that objective? Assume that the
variable being measured is Normally distributed with $\sigma = 14$.\
**Step 1. Write the rule for rejecting $H_0$ in terms of $\bar{x}_*$.**

By definition, $$\alpha = P(\text{we reject } H_0 \mid \mu = 100)
= P\left( \bar{X} > \bar{x}_* \mid \mu = 100 \right)
= P\left( Z > \frac{\bar{x}_* - 100}{14 / \sqrt{n}} \right) = 0.05$$

From the standard normal table, $P(Z > 1.645) = 0.05$, so:
$$\bar{x}_* = 100 + 1.645 \cdot \frac{14}{\sqrt{n}}$$

**Step 2. The power is the probability of this event under the condition
that the alternative $\mu = 103$ is true.**

To calculate this probability, standardize $\bar{x}$ using $\mu = 103$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{power} &= 1 - \beta = P(\bar{X} > \bar{x}_* \mid \mu = 103) \\
&= P\left( Z > \frac{\bar{x}_* - 103}{14 / \sqrt{n}} \right) = 0.60
\end{aligned}$$

From the standard normal table,
$P(Z > -0.25) \approx 0.5987 \approx 0.60$, so:
$$\frac{\bar{x}_* - 103}{14 / \sqrt{n}} = -0.25
\Rightarrow
\bar{x}_* = 103 - 0.25 \cdot \frac{14}{\sqrt{n}}$$

**Step 3. Solving for $n$**

From Steps 1 and 2:
$$100 + 1.645 \cdot \frac{14}{\sqrt{n}} = 103 - 0.25 \cdot \frac{14}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Solving for $n$:
$$\left( \frac{(1.645 + 0.25) \cdot 14}{103 - 100} \right)^2 \approx 78.2045$$

Therefore, a minimum of 79 observations must be taken to guarantee that
the hypothesis test will have the desired power of at least 0.60.

::: example
A vending machine advertises that it dispenses 225 ml cups of coffee
($\sigma = 7$ ml). You believe the mean volume of coffee per cup is
something less than 225 ml. You plan to sample 40 cups of coffee from
this machine to test your hypothesis.

1.  If the true mean volume of coffee per cup is 223 ml, what is the
    power of your test at $\alpha = 0.05$? *(Homework)*

2.  How many coffee cups should you sample if you want to raise the
    power in part (a) to 0.80?

**Solution (b):**

**Step 1. Write the rule for rejecting $H_0$ in terms of $\bar{x}_*$.**

By definition: $$\begin{aligned}
\alpha &= P(\text{we reject } H_0 \mid \mu = 225) \\
&= P(\bar{X} < \bar{x}_* \mid \mu = 225) \\
&= P\left( Z < \frac{\bar{x}_* - 225}{7 / \sqrt{n}} \right) = 0.05
\end{aligned}$$

From the standard normal table, $P(Z < -1.645) = 0.05$, so:
$$\bar{x}_* = 225 - 1.645 \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt{n}}$$

**Step 2. The power is the probability of this event under the condition
that the alternative $\mu = 223$ is true.**

To calculate this probability, standardize $\bar{x}$ using $\mu = 223$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{power} &= 1 - \beta = P(\bar{X} < \bar{x}_* \mid \mu = 223) \\
&= P\left( Z < \frac{\bar{x}_* - 223}{7 / \sqrt{n}} \right) = 0.80
\end{aligned}$$

From the table, $P(Z < 0.84) = 0.7995 \approx 0.80$, so:
$$\frac{\bar{x}_* - 223}{7 / \sqrt{n}} = 0.84
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\bar{x}_* = 223 + 0.84 \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt{n}}$$

**Step 3. Solving for $n$**

From Steps 1 and 2:
$$225 - 1.645 \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt{n}} = 223 + 0.84 \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Solving for $n$:
$$n = \left( \frac{(1.645 + 0.84) \cdot 7}{225 - 223} \right)^2 \approx 75.6465$$

Therefore, a minimum of 76 observations must be taken to guarantee that
the hypothesis test will have the desired precision.

$$\text{Power}(\mu_a) = \pi(\mu_a) = P \left[ Z \leq -Z_{\alpha} + \frac{\sqrt{n}(\mu_0 - \mu_a)}{\sigma} \right]$$

**where** $\mu_a < \mu_0$.

**If $H_a : \mu \ne \mu_0$, then** $$\begin{aligned}
\text{Power}(\mu_a) &= \pi(\mu_a) \\
&= 1 - P \left[ -Z_{\alpha/2} + \frac{\sqrt{n}(\mu_0 - \mu_a)}{\sigma} \leq Z \leq Z_{\alpha/2} + \frac{\sqrt{n}(\mu_0 - \mu_a)}{\sigma} \right]
\end{aligned}$$

**where** $\mu_a \ne \mu_0$.

**You need to know:**

- Standard deviation, $\sigma$

- Significance level, $\alpha$

- Effect size to detect, $\mu_0 - \mu_a$
:::

Calculations of power (or of error probabilities) are useful for
planning studies because we can make these calculations before we have
any data. Once we actually have data, it is more common to report a
P-value rather than a reject-or-not decision at a fixed significance
level $\alpha$. The P-value measures the strength of the evidence
provided by the data against $H_0$. It leaves any action or decision
based on that evidence up to each individual. Different people may
require different strengths of evidence.
