In statistics, simple linear regression (SLR) is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. In other words, we use linear functions to illustrate the relationship of variables (ie. time and one's height). The goal of simple linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line, known as the regression line, that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable. For example we are interested a people's height within 10 months. Then, we use coordinate system to draw each data point and use simple linear regression to find a function which perfectly describes the relationship between height and time.

\caption{An illustration of simple linear regression. The blue points are measures of height monthly, and the red line is our SLR model. In this case $m$ is the slope which tells you the rate of change, $b$ is the intercept which may have a special meaning depending on the case.}
\end{figure}

Now, you may wonder the accuracy of this model. In statistics, we do have parameters that approximate the slope and intercept of the function $y = mx + b$. The model we are going to use is: $\hat{y} = \hat{\beta_1}x + \hat{\beta_0} + \epsilon$. From this model, the slope and the intercept are $\hat{\beta_1}$, $\hat{\beta_{0}}$ respectively ($\hat{\beta_1}$ and $\hat{\beta_{0}}$ are unbiased estimators). Moreover, the $\epsilon$-term is called error term, which we will discuss it later.

\section{Measures of Linear Relationship}

Before we formally introduce simple linear regression, there are some measures of SLR that should be discussed.\\

\textbf{Covariance (Sample Covariance)}

In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. The covariance sign shows the direction of the linear relationship between two variables. If higher values of one variable tend to occur with higher values of the other (and lower with lower), the covariance is positive, meaning the variables move in the same direction. If higher values of one variable tend to occur with lower values of the other, the covariance is negative, meaning they move in opposite directions. The size (magnitude) of the covariance reflects how much the two variables vary together, based on the variances they share.

\begin{definition}[Covariance (sample covariance)]
The formula of sample covariance is given by: \[ S_{xy} = \frac{1}{n-1} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i \cdot y_i}{n -1} - \frac{n\bar{x}\bar{y}}{n-1}.\]
These are two ways to compute covariance. Both will lead you find the same answer of covariance.
\end{definition}

Basically, covariance indicates that how two variables move together.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If covariance of two random variables is greater than $0$ ($cov(x,y) > 0$), then the two random variables show the same trend. That is: if one random variable is increasing, then the other one is also increasing; while if one random variable is decreasing, then the other one is also decreasing.
	\item If covariance of two random variables is less than $0$ ($cov(x,y) < 0$), then the two random variables show the opposite trend. That is: if one random variable is increasing, then the other one is decreasing; while if one random variable is decreasing, then the other one is increasing.
	\item If covariance of two random variables is equal to $0$ ($cov(x,y) = 0$), then we say that there is no relationship (systematically linear) between the two random variables.
\end{itemize}

Note that covariance is not standardized, so it can be difficult to interpret directly.\\

\textbf{Coefficient of Correlation}

In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. It helps us understand whether and how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while a negative correlation means that one variable tends to decrease as the other increases. The degree of correlation is usually expressed with a correlation coefficient, which ranges from $-1$ to $+1$.

\begin{definition}[Coefficient of correlation]
The coefficient of correlation is given by: \[ r_{xy} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_x \cdot S_y}.\]
Now, $r_{xy} = $ sample correlation coefficient, $S_{xy} = $ sample covariance, $S_{x} = $ sample standard deviation of $x$, $S_{y} = $ sample standard deviation of $y$. Also, remember that the range of coefficient of correlation is between $-1$ and $+1$: $r_{xy} \in [-1, +1]$.
\end{definition}

The correlation r measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two quantitative variables $x$ and $y$. Although you calculate a correlation for any scatter plot, $r$ measures only straight-line relationships. In short, coefficient of correlation is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two random variables.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If $r_{xy} \approx +1$, then we say that the two random variables have a strong positive correlation.	(See figure 15.2)

\end{figure}

	\item If $r_{xy} \approx -1$, then we say that the two random variables have a strong negative correlation.	 (See figure 15.3)
\begin{figure}[H]

  \filldraw[red] (5,0) circle (2pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{An illustration of strong negative correlation ($r_{xy} \approx -1$).}
\end{figure}

	\item If $r_{xy} \approx 0$, then we say that there is essentially no correlation between the two random variables. Note that if $r \approx 0$, then it suggests a linear relationship doesn't exist but other relationship may exist. (See figure 15.4)
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[->, thick]
  \draw[->] (-1,0) -- (7,0) node[right] {$x$};
  \draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,5) node[above] {$y$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{An illustration of no correlation ($r_{xy} \approx 0$).}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}

Note that correlation doesn't imply causation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $cor(x,y) \approx +1$ doesn't necessarily imply on increase in x causes increase in y.
	\item $cor(x,y) \approx -1$ doesn't necessarily imply on increase in x causes decrease in y.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Properties of Covariance and Correlation}

These two values are symmetric:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $cov(x,y) = cov(y,x)$;
	\item $cor(x,y) = cor(y,x)$.
\end{itemize}

(a) Compute the sample covariance.

(b) Compute and interpret the sample correlation coefficient.

\textbf{Solution:}

Step 1: Compute $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$; $\bar{x} = 8$ and $\bar{y} = 46$ (check this by yourself).

Step 2: Find $s_x$ and $s_y$.
\vspace{-0.5cm}

$$s_x^2 = \frac{1}{5-1} \cdot \sum_{i = 1}^{5}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 29.5 \text{ and } s_y^2 = \frac{1}{5-1} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{5}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = 130$$
\hspace*{3.5em}Then: $s_x = 5.4313$ and $s_y = 11.4017$.

Step 3: Find $s_{xy}$ and $r$.
\vspace{-0.75cm}

$$\sum_{i=1}^{5}x_i \cdot y_i = 1600, \text{ then } s_{xy} = \frac{1600}{5-1} - \frac{5\cdot8\cdot46}{5-1} = -60 \text{ and } r_{xy} = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x \cdot s_y} = 0.9688.$$

\section{Least Squares Method}

The method of least squares is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best-fitting function by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed data points and the values predicted by the model. It interested in a linear model of the form: $y  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p \cdot x_p + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, $x_i$'s ($i = 1,..., p$) are independent predictors, $\beta_j$'s ($j = 0,..., p$) are coefficients, $y$ is dependent variable.\\

Using sample data, we get estimates of this model of the form: $\hat{y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} \cdot x_1 + \cdots + \hat{\beta_p} \cdot x_p$. Now, $\hat{y}$ is predicated $y$, $x_i$'s ($i = 1,...,p$) are independent predicators, $\hat{\beta_j}$'s ($j = 0,...,p$) are estimated coefficients. Moreover, $\hat{\beta_0}$ is intercept; $\hat{\beta_1},...,\hat{\beta_p}$ are quantifiers how much $y$ changes with a unit increase in $x_i$'s.\\

In this course, we focus on the following model a bit more: $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1\cdot x$, where $b_0$ is the y-intercept, and $b_1$ is the slope, and $\hat{y}$ is the value of $y$ determined by the line. The coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ are derived using Calculus so that we minimize the sum of squared deviations: $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$. Then the least squares line coefficients are $b_1 = r \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x}$ and $b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1\cdot \bar{x}$.\\

\textbf{Facts about Least Squares Method}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The distinction between explanatory and response variables is essential in Least Squares Method.
	\item The least-squares line (trendline) always passes through the point ($\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$) on the graph of $y$ against $x$.
	\item The square of the correlation, $r^2$, is the fraction of the variation in the values of $y$ that is explained by the variation in $x$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
A tool die maker operates out of a small shop making specialized tools. He is considering increasing the size of his business and needs to know more about his costs. One such cost is electricity, which he needs to operate his machines and lights. He keeps track of his daily electricity costs and the number of tools that he made that day. These data are listed next. Determine the fixed and variable electricity costs using the Least Squares Method.

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
Day & Number of tools ($X$) & Electricity costs ($Y$)\\
$1$ & $7$ & $23.80$\\
$2$ & $3$ & $11.89$\\
$3$ & $2$ & $15.89$\\
$4$ & $5$ & $26.11$\\
$5$ & $8$ & $31.79$\\
$6$ & $11$ & $39.93$\\
$7$ & $5$ & $12.27$\\
$8$ & $15$ & $40.06$\\
$9$ & $3$ & $21.38$\\
$10$ & $6$ & $18.65$\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data of example 15.2}
\end{figure}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.75cm}

Solution:

Step 1: Entering Data;

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!50, arc=2mm]
\begin{verbatim}
tools=c(7,3,2,5,8,11,5,15,3,6);

cost=c(23.80,11.89,15.98,26.11,31.79, 39.93,12.27,40.06,21.38,18.65);
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Step 2: Finding Slope;

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!50, arc=2mm]
\begin{verbatim}
Sx=sd(tools); 

Sy=sd(cost); 

r=cor(tools,cost); 

b1=r*(Sy/Sx); 

b1;
 
## [1] 2.245882
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Step 3: Finding $y$-intercept;

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!50, arc=2mm]
\begin{verbatim}
x.bar=mean(tools); 

y.bar=mean(cost);

b0=y.bar - b1*x.bar;

b0; 

## [1] 9.587765
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

We can also use R-code to draw a graph:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!50, arc=2mm]
\begin{verbatim}
plot(tools,cost,pch=19);

abline(least.squares$coeff,col="red");

# pch=19 tells R to draw solid circles; 

# abline tells R to add trendline;
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

Interpretation: 

The slope measures the marginal rate of change in the dependent variable. In this example, the slope is $2.25$, which means that in this sample, for each one-unit increase in the number of tools, the marginal increase in the electricity cost is $\$ 2.25$ per tool.

The $y$-intercept is $9.57$; that is, the line strikes the $y$-axis at $9.57$. However, when $x = 0$, we are producing no tools and hence the estimated ﬁxed cost of electricity is $ \$9.57$ per day .
