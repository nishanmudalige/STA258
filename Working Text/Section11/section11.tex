\chapter{Introduction to Hypothesis Testing}
\label{ch:intro-hypothesis}

\section{Test of Hypothesis for One Mean}

\begin{definition}[Hypothesis Tests]
An inferential procedure to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a condition for a population parameter using statistics from a sample.
\end{definition}


\textcolor{blue}{Attach a probability to the conclusion of a hypothesis test.}

\subsubsection*{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Decide on a level of significance ($\alpha$)
    \item State the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) \textcolor{blue}{($H_1$)}
    \item Calculate the appropriate test statistic.
    \item Use the test statistic and a reference distribution to calculate a p-value. \\
    \textcolor{blue}{(Also refer back to $H_a$)}
    \item Compare p-value to $\alpha$ to make a conclusion.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{blue}{Note:} \\
\textcolor{blue}{The definition of a p-value can be confusing. We will define it later.}

\subsection*{Step 1: Decide on a Level of Significance ($\alpha$)}
-Threshold for decision making.

-Depends on tolerance for consequences of errors, sample size, nature of the study, and variability.

-Common values: $0.10$, $0.01$, $0.05$ \textcolor{blue}{(very common default)}

\subsection*{Step 2: State the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) and the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)}

\textbf{$\Theta$:} parameter of interest

\textbf{$\Theta_0$:} numerical value of the parameter of interest hypothesized under the null hypothesis.

\[
\begin{array}{lll}
H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & (\Theta \leq \Theta_0) & H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0 \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{one-sided (one-tailed)}} \\
H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & (\Theta \geq \Theta_0) & H_a: \Theta < \Theta_0 \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{one-sided (one-tailed)}} \\
H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 &                         & H_a: \Theta \neq \Theta_0 \quad \textcolor{purple}{\text{two-sided (two-tailed)}}
\end{array}
\]


\textbf{Null ($H_0$):} Represents the current belief (\textcolor{blue}{status quo}) or the safe belief.

\textbf{Alternative ($H_a$):} Represents the research hypothesis (or what you are asked to test)
\subsection*{Step 3: Calculate an appropriate test statistic}

Depends on the hypothesis test conducted and the information available.


\begin{definition}[Test Statistic Skeleton]
\[
\text{test statistic} = \frac{\text{(a statistic)} - \text{(hypothesized value of parameters under } H_0 \text{)}}{\text{standard error of statistic}}
\]
\end{definition}

The test statistic follows a reference distribution ($Z$, $t$, $F$, $\chi^2$).
\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate the p-value}

\noindent
Use the test statistic, reference distribution, and refer back to $H_a$.

  \caption*{Two-tailed test: p-value is the total area in both tails beyond $\pm$ test statistic.}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Step 5: Compare \textit{p}-value to level of significance $\alpha$ and make a conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If \textit{p}-value $< \alpha$: \\
  \quad Sufficient evidence against $H_0$. The hypothesis test rejects $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$.

  \item If \textit{p}-value $> \alpha$: \\
  \quad Insufficient evidence against $H_0$. Do not reject $H_0$ (fail to reject $H_0$).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} It is not good practice to give conclusions in the context of stating we \textit{accept $H_0$} or \textit{accept $H_a$}.
\begin{example}[Sweetening Colas]
Diet colas use artificial sweeteners to avoid sugar. These sweeteners gradually lose their sweetness over time. Manufacturers therefore test new colas for loss of sweetness before marketing them. Trained tasters sip the cola along with drinks of standard sweetness and score the cola on a “sweetness score” of 1 to 10. The cola is then stored for a month at high temperature to imitate the effect of four months’ storage at room temperature. Each taster scores the cola again after storage. This is a matched pairs experiment. Our data are the differences (score before storage minus score after storage) in the tasters’ scores. The bigger these differences, the bigger the loss of sweetness.

Suppose we know that for any cola, the sweetness loss scores vary from taster to taster according to a Normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma = 1$. The mean $\mu$ for all tasters measures loss of sweetness.

The following are the sweetness losses for a new cola as measured by 10 trained tasters:

\medskip
\centerline{2.0,\ 0.4,\ 0.7,\ 2.0,\ -0.4,\ 2.2,\ -1.3,\ 1.2,\ 1.1,\ 2.3}
\medskip

Are these data good evidence that the cola lost sweetness in storage?\\
\noindent\textbf{Solution}\\

$\mu$ = mean sweetness loss for the population of \textbf{all} tasters.\\
\textbf{Step 1:} State hypotheses. $H_0: \mu = 0$ vs $H_a: \mu > 0$ \\
\textbf{Step 2:} Test statistic: $z_\star = \dfrac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \dfrac{1.02 - 0}{1 / \sqrt{10}} = 3.23$ \\
\textbf{Step 3:} P-value. $P(Z > z_\star) = P(Z > 3.23) = 0.0006$ \\
\textbf{Step 4:} Conclusion. We would rarely observe a mean as large as 1.02 if $H_0$ were true. The small p-value provides strong evidence against $H_0$, supporting $H_a: \mu > 0$. That is, the mean sweetness loss is likely positive.

\begin{example}[UTM Deer]
Deer are a common sight on the UTM campus. Suppose an ecologist is interested in the average mass of adult white-tailed does (female deer) around the Mississauga campus to determine whether they are healthy for the upcoming winter. The ecologist captures a sample of 36 adult females around the UTM and measures the average mass of this sample to be 42.53 kg.

From previous studies conducted in the area, the average mass of healthy does was reported to be 45 kg. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5\% significance level to determine whether the mass of does around UTM has decreased. Assume the standard deviation is known to be 5.25 kg.


\vspace{1em}

\textbf{1. Level of significance.} \(\alpha = 0.05\)

\textbf{2. State the null and alternative hypotheses.}
\[
H_0: \mu = 45 \qquad H_a: \mu < 45
\]

\textbf{3. Calculate appropriate test statistic.}

\vspace{0.5em}

Given:
\[
n = 36, \quad \bar{x} = 42.53, \quad \sigma = 5.25
\]

Since \(\sigma\) is known, the test statistic is:
\[
z^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{42.53 - 45}{5.25/\sqrt{36}} = -2.82
\]

Reference distribution: standard normal

\textbf{4. Calculate p-value}

\[
\text{p-value} = P(Z < -2.82) \approx 0.0024
\]

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{section11/images/deer_pvalue.pdf}
\caption{Left-tailed p-value for the test statistic \( z^* = -2.82 \)}
\end{figure}

\textbf{5. Compare p-value with level of significance \(\alpha\) and make a conclusion:}

\[
0.0024 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{p-value} < \alpha
\]

There is sufficient evidence at the 5\% level of significance to reject the null that does this winter weigh the same as in the past and to conclude the alternative that does this winter weigh less than 45 kg.

There is sufficient evidence at the 5\% level of significance to reject the null hypothesis. We conclude that the average mass of does this winter is significantly less than 45 kg.
